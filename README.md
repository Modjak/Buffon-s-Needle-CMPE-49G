# Buffon's Needle

Bogazici University - Fundementals of Particle-Based Simulations CMPE 49G

This Python script simulates Buffon's Needle experiment using a Monte Carlo method.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the script and provide the following arguments:

- `N`: Number of needles to drop.
- `L`: Length of the needle.
- `D`: Distance between the parallel lines on the floor.

Example usage:

```bash
python simulation.py 10000 5 10
```
The above command will simulate dropping 10,000 needles, each of length 5 units, onto a floor with lines spaced 10 units apart.
